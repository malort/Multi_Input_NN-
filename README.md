# Multi_Input_NN-

The goal of this project is to build a keras model automatically based on the structure of the data.


## Data:

## Requirements:

```pandas:``` Data analysis and manipulation tool.

```spacy:``` is an open-source software library for advanced natural language processing.

```string:``` Common string operations module.

```re:``` This module provides regular expression matching operations

```nltk:``` The Natural Language Toolkit is a suite of libraries and programs for symbolic an statistical natural language processing (NLP).

```keras:``` Open-source software library that provides a Python interface for artificial neural networks. Keras acts as an interface for the TensorFlow library

```scikit-learn:``` Machine Learning library.

## Description: 

### First part: Preprocess and cleaning data. 



### Second part: Deep Learning solution. 

The solution presented is a Multi-input Neural Network. The model is built up layer by layer based on the category of the input columns.
